-- Create a service:
To create a service, use the create command. You must also pass in a runtime (e.g., node.js, python etc.) you would like to write the service in.
You can also pass in a path to create a directory and auto-name your service:

# Create service with nodeJS template in the folder ./myService
serverless create --template aws-nodejs --path myService --name nameOfService


-- We can use test the functions locally using: serverless invoke local --function command.
-- To deploy a function as a lambda function to aws account: serverless deploy #this will deploy all the js files in the current directory as a lambda
function.

-- lambda functions do not have endpoint of their own and thus we use api gateways for it.
